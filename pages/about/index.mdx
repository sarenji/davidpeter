# Hi!

I'm David. I write code and words. I'm passionate about accessibility and
disability.

If you found this website inaccessible, I would definitely appreciate an email
at david.a.peter \[at] gmail.com. However, no pressure to educate me.

## Coding

I specialize in JavaScript, particularly for the frontend. I am experienced in
Ruby on Rails.

### Kickstarter: March 2014 &ndash; November 2017

Brooklyn, NY

- Joined as the third frontend engineer. We still used jQuery soup then. The
  team later expanded to be about 10 frontend engineers.
- Did a lot of Ruby on Rails. In the beginning, we wore many hats.
- Introduced accessibility as a product value. Helped educate coworkers and
  set up processes for accessibility.
- Implemented [subtitles and captions](https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/introducing-subtitles-and-captions)
  for all videos, including a tool to help users generate their own.
- Helped architect the new frontend codebase in Webpack, ES6, React, Redux,
  and GraphQL. This included education and architecture ideation,
  implementation, and processes.
- Became team lead for the biggest feature team. Worked on a significant
  React/Redux project that involved GraphQL. Led 4 engineers. We rewrote one
  of the core, critical flows at Kickstarter: Project Build.
- Can regale you with tales of trade-offs. Programming design, selecting
  technologies, agreeing on best practices, communicating changes to other
  people.

### Apple (Intern): June 2013 &ndash; August 2013

Cupertino, CA

- Did data analysis.
- Introduced automated testing to my team's stack.
- Realized this company was not for me.

### 1000memories: May 2011 &ndash; May 2012

San Francisco, CA

- About 10 people worked for this startup.
- Worked as an intern for 3 months, then took a break in college to work
  full-time for the remaining 9 months.
- The client was written in JavaScript, and, later, CoffeeScript.
- Wrote a dynamic photo uploader and photo importer. The importer integrated
  with the Instagram and Facebook APIs. Within 2 weeks of release, imported
  photos amounted to over 25% of all total photos on the site.
- Helped write the core 1000memories API, written in Sinatra (Ruby).
- [Had a patch to Ruby on Rails accepted](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/27d327e63a3ac661cd22b207d9022f8661163853).

## Education

I graduated _summa cum laude_ with a 4.0 GPA from the Rochester
Institute of Technology (RIT).
